# Maze-Of-Waze-v2

This is a project in the second year of Ariel University OOP course.
This project uses a representation of directional graphs and applies these data structures to simulate a game using coordinates
from google map. The game is based on dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path - allowing robots(or a player) to traverse the graph
and look for "fruit".
